                  <p className="mt-1">
                    I began my journey in Psychology, fascinated by how people
                    think and solve problems. But at some point, I felt lost...
                    and that led me to revisit my lifelong passion for
                    technology. Studying Computer Science and completing
                    BrainStationâ€™s Software Engineering Bootcamp helped me
                    rebuild my path, this time through real-world projects,
                    hands-on learning, and collaborative environments.

                  <p className="mt-1">
                    What I enjoy most about this field is the constant evolution
                    â€” thereâ€™s always something new to learn or improve. Whether
                    itâ€™s refining a user experience, fixing a tricky bug, or
                    developing an interactive feature, I find joy in turning
                    complex problems into clear, thoughtful solutions. My
                    attention to detail and ability to resolve issues quickly
                    have been recognized in fast-paced, team-driven projects,
                    where I thrive on collaboration and shared learning.

                  </h3>
                  <p className="mt-1">
                    Outside of code, I like to get creative with hobbies like
                    crocheting and other hands-on projects. They help me think
                    differently and recharge. Iâ€™m excited to keep growing,
                    collaborating, and creating work that makes a meaningful
                    impact.
